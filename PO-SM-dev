goals and responsabilties of product owner, analisy and define priorities, PO's for transform. Product owner: represent the profissional and visualixxe the value, he valide the // he can cancel some sprint, replanning some sprint, if anything be possible, // scrum: product owner(po), scrum master(sm), team of development(dev), no hierachy, scrum master make the agile coulture, the team have to be more// PO represent the business area, he is not a commit, define functionalities of software (product backlog), priorixxe the function besides the value of business, guaranteer the developmet to iten of backlog of level necesary. present and all the time to the team, or don't delay, all doubt is valide, // refining and planning: product backlog(select product increment), sprint backlog 
On planning no one have to be on doubt, read all the story for the team, // sprint backlog: user login, ssl enable, reset lost password, account lockout after three attempts. 
release planning: release a new version of product of this software, any time is the product will be create or change, the dev have to decide if it will be distributed or change // much more sprint more complex the realease will be
2 types: release planning for multiple squads(after the sprint all the release divide will be given by differents teams, to up to the product, the PO doesn't participated of this) or release planning of the project (PO have some big demands, the PO have to be senior, the real demand of the story, and have to broke all the story, example: doenst possible the new authenticator, the demand have clear, but the all sprint are nt numerable, for test with the client to caption all the development// the project, PO is not the manager project of scrum/ define the major given of the client, planning the demand for the client, with the return of the client to the sotyr have to be more value, or if the given will be , depends need to finish the finish one or two refresh of client, so be more consiste of the given)/
which characteristic is better for PO: udertsnd the demmand and extract the more value of the demand. 
which is the goal of the PO of the team: helps the team to understand the goal and helps the team to finish the sprint. 

define the escopo and the priority: define is the best part because of the goals, what is the goals, before the finish, more posibilitiesm , disponible more tools to locomoted, given the mood to locomoted, given the goals, and validated the way make sense, at the second sprint more instability, ... the last sprint is the product, thats the resume the product given is each more value and given more necessity to the person who using the product, // because of that is to validated every given, to attendance the client.
product backlog: themer example a website/ the creation fot he cart page. (epic) user can add the necessary items in his cart, user can remove the unnecessaru items from the cart (user stories) add the page and the link "cart" on the main website page, add the button "add to the cart" after every item. add the bottom "remove from the cart after every item, add the button "open my cart" on every website : tasks

KPI: GOALS 
  tags: mesure the KPI 
Risks and rewards: positives(a lot of teams works of anothers teams, more gains development on the system) or negatives(itens of the date, cousts, and the part of project wich will be doing be unavailable for some project)  
flux to the client cancel something: when it have to cancel in call center, 
which is the methods more efficent to the project: understand the gain and after define the escopo of project. 
product backlog: epic and story 
importance to mapping positive risks: prioritixxe other itens on backlog, 

Digital transform: change the transfor is given is more about person than tech, how we can less process and potencilixxe result, change the mindset
